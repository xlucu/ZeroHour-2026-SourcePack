# Command & Conquer: Generals Zero Hour — Android

<img src="assets/android-screenshot.png" alt="Generals Zero Hour main menu running on Android tablet" width="600">

**The full 2003 RTS engine running natively on Android tablets** — not emulation,
not a compatibility layer. The real C++ engine compiled for arm64, rendering
DirectX 8 → [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) → Vulkan on Adreno/Mali GPUs.
This is the **first-ever DXVK build for Android**.

> ⚠️ **You must own a legal copy of the game.** No game assets are included or
> distributed. See [How to Play](#how-to-play) below.

## How to Play

### What you need

1. **An Android tablet** with:
   - **arm64-v8a** architecture (all modern tablets)
   - **Android 7.0+** (API 24+, for system Vulkan support)
   - A **Vulkan-capable GPU** (Adreno 7xx+, Mali-G77+, or equivalent)
   - **~3GB free RAM** for the game process
   - **~2.5GB storage** for game data

2. **A legal copy of C&C Generals Zero Hour**:
   - [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2732960/) (~$5 on sale, includes base game + Zero Hour)
   - Or any retail/EA App/Origin install
   - You need the **Complete Edition** or both Generals + Zero Hour installed

### Step 1: Download the APK

Grab the latest APK from the [**Releases page**](../../releases).

### Step 2: Install the APK

```bash
# Enable "Install from unknown sources" for your file manager first
adb install GeneralsZH-full.apk

# Or transfer the APK to your tablet and tap it in Files
```

### Step 3: Copy your game data

The game needs its `.big` archive files on your tablet's filesystem:

```bash
# Create the game data directory on the tablet
adb shell mkdir -p /sdcard/Android/data/me.generalsx.zh/files/GameData/Data

# Copy ALL .big files from your PC install to the tablet
# (from your Generals install directory, typically):
#   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Generals\
adb push "*.big" /sdcard/Android/data/me.generalsx.zh/files/GameData/Data/

# The fonts are bundled in the APK and extract automatically on first launch.
```

**Required .big files** (copy all of these from your install's `Data/` folder):

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `INI.big` | Base game INI data (weapons, objects, etc.) |
| `INIZH.big` | Zero Hour INI data |
| `Textures.big` / `TexturesZH.big` | Game textures |
| `Audio.big` / `AudioZH.big` | Sound effects |
| `Music.big` / `MusicZH.big` | Music tracks |
| `MapsZH.big` | Map data |
| `Terrain.big` / `TerrainZH.big` | Terrain data |
| `W3D.big` / `W3DZH.big` | 3D models |
| `English.big` / `EnglishZH.big` | English text/speech |
| `Speech*.big` | Voice-over files |
| `Window.big` / `WindowZH.big` | UI textures |
| `ShadersZH.big` | Shaders |

### Step 4: Play

Launch **"Generals ZH"** from your app drawer. The main menu should appear
within a few seconds.

## Touch Controls

The touch input system maps touchscreen gestures to the RTS mouse semantics the
2003 engine expects:

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Tap** | Left-click (select unit, click button) |
| **Tap and hold (600ms)** | Right-click (context menu, deselect) |
| **Drag** | Left-click drag (selection box) |
| **Two-finger drag** | Right-click drag (camera pan) |
| **Two-finger pinch** | Mouse wheel (zoom in/out) |

---

## Build from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Android NDK r27** (27.1.12297006)
- **Android SDK** with build-tools 35.0.0
- **CMake 3.25+** and **Ninja**
- **Meson** (for DXVK cross-compilation)
- **Android Studio** or Gradle 8.7+ (for the APK packaging)

### Build steps

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/tarek369/GeneralsZH-Android.git
cd GeneralsZH-Android

# Initialize the DXVK fork submodule
git submodule update --init references/fbraz3-dxvk

# Configure + build the native engine (arm64-v8a)
cmake --preset android-game
cmake --build build/android-game --target z_generals

# Package the APK (stages fonts, DXVK .so, SDL3 .so, etc.)
./scripts/build/android/package-android-zh.sh

# The signed APK appears at:
#   android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

## What This Port Involved

Getting a 2003 Windows DirectX 8 game running natively on Android required:

1. **DXVK for Android aarch64** — DXVK had never been built for Android. Required
   gating x86 SSE flags, fixing the SDL3 WSI soname, and a high-DPI WSI patch.
2. **Android NDK cross-compilation** of the 500k LOC engine — resolving every
   missing POSIX function (`pthread_cancel`, `glob`, `sys/timeb`), every libc++
   difference (`std::from_chars` float overload missing), and every assumption
   the engine made about having a writable filesystem.
3. **BIG archive file override** — the engine's archive system loaded base
   Generals data instead of Zero Hour data because of a `multimap::insert` hint
   ordering bug. Fixed with erase-and-reinsert to guarantee override precedence.
4. **Memory allocator coexistence** — the engine's custom DMA allocator
   intercepted all `operator delete` calls, including those from OpenAL and
   libc++. Fixed with a magic cookie check to distinguish engine allocations.
5. **DXVK device creation** — the `CreateDevice` call failed because the engine's
   fullscreen format-selection path returned `D3DFMT_UNKNOWN` on Android (no
   desktop display modes). Fixed by forcing the windowed format path on all
   non-Windows platforms.
6. **Font extraction** — Android APK assets are invisible to `fopen()`. The
   engine's FreeType font locator expects `fonts/*.ttf` on the filesystem.
   Added JNI-based extraction from `AAssetManager` on first launch.

```

The engine speaks DirectX 8. DXVK translates those calls to Vulkan. The Android
Vulkan driver renders to the screen. No Wine, no QEMU, no emulation — the engine
itself is compiled as a native Android shared library (`libmain.so`).
