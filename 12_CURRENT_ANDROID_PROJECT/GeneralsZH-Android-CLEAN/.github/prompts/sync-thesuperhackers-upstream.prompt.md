# Sync TheSuperHackers Upstream

Perform a full upstream sync from the `thesuperhackers` remote into this repository while preserving the working cross-platform nature of `GeneralsX`.

## Briefing

`TheSuperHackers` and `GeneralsX` have different goals and this must drive every merge decision:

- `TheSuperHackers` focuses on bug fixes, stability, optimizations, and merging the `Generals` and `GeneralsMD` codebases while preserving compatibility with the original Windows binaries.
- `GeneralsX` focuses on making the game truly cross-platform with a modern stack based on SDL3 + DXVK + OpenAL + FFmpeg, without prioritizing original binary compatibility.

The repository is significantly behind upstream `TheSuperHackers`. The purpose of this sync is to import useful upstream improvements without regressing or dismantling the already functional cross-platform architecture in `GeneralsX`.

## Required Workflow

1. Verify the working tree is clean before starting (`git status --porcelain` should be empty). If it is not clean, stop and ask the user how to proceed.
2. Determine the current local date and create a branch named exactly `thesuperhackers-sync-MM-DD-YYYY`.
3. Verify whether the remote `thesuperhackers` exists.
4. If the remote does not exist, create it using `git@github.com:TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode.git`.
5. Fetch `thesuperhackers`.
6. Merge `thesuperhackers/main` into the new branch.
7. Create a detailed conflict resolution plan based on the merge result and the critical merge instructions below. Document this plan clearly before starting to resolve conflicts.
  - The document must include a list of the most important conflicts, the reasoning behind how they will be resolved, and any special considerations or constraints that will be applied during resolution.
  - For large or complex conflicts, outline the specific steps that will be taken to analyze and resolve them, including any reference materials or repository documentation that will be consulted.
  - The plan should also identify any areas of the codebase that are expected to be particularly risky or contentious during the merge, and how those risks will be mitigated.
  - The upstream could be moved some files into a unified `Core/` directory, we need to follow the upstream structure but also preserve the cross-platform architecture of `GeneralsX`, so carefcul analysis will be required to reconcile these changes.
  - Split the plan into sections if necessary to cover different subsystems or types of conflicts (for example: build system conflicts, platform abstraction conflicts, gameplay code conflicts, etc.).
8. Load the plan into working memory and execute it step by step, documenting the outcome of each major decision and conflict resolution in detail.
9. Ensure no unresolved merge markers remain anywhere in the tree before validation (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
10. Ensure the repository remains buildable and configurable after conflict resolution.
11. Validate runtime smoke for both products on validated platforms: `GeneralsXZH` and `GeneralsX` should at minimum enter and exit the main loop cleanly.
12. Remove generated runtime/build artifacts from the working tree before commit (for example local shader/DXVK caches).
13. Commit the final merge result.
14. Push the branch `thesuperhackers-sync-MM-DD-YYYY` to origin.

## Critical Merge Instructions

Expect many conflicts because the projects intentionally diverged. Every conflict must be analyzed individually and in detail.

- Expect many files moved from `Generals/` and `GeneralsMD/` into a unified `Core/` directory. 
- **IMPORTANT:** never ever assume that all conflicts in those areas should be resolved by keeping the `TheSuperHackers` version or the `GeneralsX` version, analyze each conflict carefully and find the real resolution.
- Do not use blanket conflict strategies for large areas of the tree.
- Do not sacrifice the cross-platform architecture of `GeneralsX` just to make the merge easy.
- Do not blindly keep either side. Reconcile changes so that useful `TheSuperHackers` bug fixes, stability work, and optimizations are preserved whenever they do not break the `GeneralsX` platform strategy.
- Preserve the functional cross-platform stack already established in `GeneralsX`: SDL3 for platform/windowing/input, DXVK for graphics, OpenAL for audio, and FFmpeg where applicable.
- Preserve platform isolation. Do not allow platform-specific code to leak into gameplay logic.
- Keep legacy compatibility paths only where they are still intentionally maintained by this repository, but do not let original-binary compatibility override the `GeneralsX` cross-platform objective.
- Treat INI parser changes as high risk on macOS: upstream numeric parsing optimizations may require platform-specific compatibility handling for Apple deployment targets.
- **Never replace our CI/CD infrastructure with upstream versions.** Our `.github/workflows/`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and all CI configuration must be kept intact. Reject any upstream additions or modifications to these paths.
- Review conflicts with extra care in these areas:
  - build system and presets
  - SDL3, DXVK, OpenAL, FFmpeg, and platform abstraction layers
  - INI parsing and file load order logic
  - shared engine code under `Core/`
  - `Generals/` and `GeneralsMD/` code that may have been unified or refactored upstream
  - launch paths, renderer setup, audio wiring, and asset/runtime integration
- If a conflict involves a removal or downgrade of an existing cross-platform capability, treat that as a high-risk decision and justify it explicitly before accepting it.
- Prefer root-cause conflict resolution over temporary hacks, disabled code paths, or quick stubs.

## Validation Requirements

It is imperative that configure and build workflows still work after the merge. At minimum, validate the relevant project tasks and report the outcome clearly.

Prioritize verifying:

- macOS configure/build flow
- Linux configure/build flow
- any touched deployment or run scripts
- core runtime paths affected by the merge

Note: validate one platform's configure/build flow fully before moving to the next. Do not attempt to validate all platforms in parallel

If the user explicitly requests a reduced validation scope (for example macOS-only), follow that scope and clearly report what was intentionally deferred.

If a full validation cannot be completed, state exactly what was not run and why.

## Deliverables

After the sync is complete, provide:

1. A concise summary of what was merged from `TheSuperHackers`.
2. A conflict-resolution report describing the most important merge decisions and why they were made.
3. A list of files or subsystems that remain risky and should receive extra review.
4. The final branch name, commit hash, and push status.
5. Pull request URL/status (if PR creation was requested).
6. A user checklist of what should be tested next.

## Required User Checklist

The final response must include a checklist covering at least:

- configure on all supported platforms
- build on all supported platforms
- game launch
- main menu
- skirmish gameplay
- campaign flow
- audio playback
- video playback
- renderer stability
- input handling
- mod loading if affected
- any feature areas touched by resolved conflicts

## Execution Notes

- Work carefully and deliberately. This is not a mechanical merge.
- Read relevant repository instructions and reference material before resolving difficult conflicts.
- Keep the final result aligned with the `GeneralsX` mission: a functional, modern, cross-platform codebase.
