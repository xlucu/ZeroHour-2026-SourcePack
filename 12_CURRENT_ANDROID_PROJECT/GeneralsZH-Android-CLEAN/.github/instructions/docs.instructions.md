## Documentation Guidelines

- All documentation **MUST BE** in English
- Use Markdown format
- Keep `docs/ETC/COMMAND_LINE_PARAMETERS.md` updated with runtime-critical diagnostic flags and caveats (for example `-logToCon` behavior differences on Linux).
- Don't add documentation files directly in the root `docs/` folder
- The root folder `/` should only contain project-level files (README.md, LICENSE, etc.)
- **Active Work**: Place in `docs/WORKDIR/` with appropriate subdirectory (phases, planning, reports, support, audit, lessons)
- **Development Diary**: Update `docs/DEV_BLOG/YYYY-MM-DIARY.md` with daily entries
  - Create new file each month (YYYY-MM-DIARY.md)
  - Order entries newest to oldest (recent at top after Overview section)
  - Keep entries informal and concise
- **Reference & Historical**: Place in `docs/ETC/` (older reference materials, archived analysis)
- **Phase Checklist Updates**: At the end of each session working on a phase, update the corresponding `docs/WORKDIR/phases/PHASEXX_*.md` file to mark completed tasks with `[x]`

**Key Rule**: DEV_BLOG is for diary only. Active work goes to WORKDIR. Reference/historical materials go to ETC.

## Documentation Updates

- **Dev diary** (`docs/DEV_BLOG/YYYY-MM-DIARY.md`): Informal session notes, newest first
- **Session reports** (`docs/WORKDIR/reports/PHASEXX_SESSIONX_*.md`): Formal summary after significant progress
- **Phase planning** (`docs/WORKDIR/phases/PHASEXX_*.md`): Update `[x]` checklist at session end
- **Technical discoveries**: Place in `docs/WORKDIR/support/` (e.g., `CRITICAL_VFS_DISCOVERY.md`)
- **Lessons learned** (`docs/WORKDIR/lessons/LESSONS_LEARNED.md`): Key takeaways from phases and work cycles
- **Known Issues**: Track in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/fbraz3/GeneralsX/issues/) — do NOT create new markdown issue files

## Documentation Organization

### `docs/WORKDIR/` - Active Working Directory
**Purpose**: All active project work during current development cycle
**Subdirectories**:

#### `docs/WORKDIR/phases/` - Phase-Specific Plans
**Purpose**: Detailed phase plans and checklists
**Guideline**: use `PHASEXX_purpose.md` format for filenames - XX is phase number, purpose is brief description
**Restriction**: Avoid using `weeks` for phase work segmentation, don't try to guess completion times in calendar weeks, just ignore this information entirely
**Rationale**: Sprints provide a standardized Agile framework terminology, ensuring consistency with sprint-based development methodologies

**Naming Examples:**
- PHASE01_INITIAL_RESEARCH.md
- PHASE02_ENGINE_SELECTION.md
- PHASE03_PROTOTYPING.md
- etc.

#### `docs/WORKDIR/planning/` - Planning & Strategic Documents
**Purpose**: Planning documents, roadmaps, architectural decisions
**Naming Convention**:
- `PLAN-XXX_description.md` for individual plans
- `ROADMAP.md` for overall project roadmap
- Other strategic planning documents

**Examples:**
- PLAN-010_VISUAL_LAYOUT.md
- PLAN-013_PARTICLE_SYSTEM.md
- ROADMAP.md

#### `docs/WORKDIR/reports/` - Session Reports & Progress
**Purpose**: Formal summaries after significant progress on phases
**Naming Convention**: `PHASEXX_SESSIONX_description.md`

**Examples:**
- PHASE01_SESSION1_INITIAL_RESEARCH_COMPLETE.md
- PHASE02_SESSION2_ENGINE_SELECTION_COMPLETE.md

#### `docs/WORKDIR/support/` - Findings & Support Documents
**Purpose**: Technical discoveries, analysis, reference materials for active phases
**Content Types**:
- Technical analysis documents
- Implementation findings
- Code reference guides
- Research supporting active work

**Examples:**
- VFS_IMPLEMENTATION_FINDINGS.md
- PARTICLE_SYSTEM_DEEP_ANALYSIS.md
- TOOLTIP_CODE_REFERENCE.md

#### `docs/WORKDIR/audit/` - Audit & Verification Files
**Purpose**: Audit logs, verification checklists, compliance documents
**Content Types**:
- Structure audits
- Implementation checklists
- Gap analysis documents
- Compliance verification

**Examples:**
- ROADMAP_AUDIT_DECEMBER_2025.md
- GAP_ANALYSIS_FINDINGS.md

#### `docs/WORKDIR/lessons/` - Lessons Learned
**Purpose**: Key insights from phases and work cycles
**Main File**: `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` - Central repository for all lessons
**Content**: Phase-specific learnings, technical insights, process improvements

### `docs/DEV_BLOG/` - Development Diary ONLY
**Purpose**: Chronological development diary entries
- YYYY-MM-DIARY.md - Monthly diary (ONE file per month)
  - YYYY is the current year
  - MM is the current month
  - DIARY is a fixed literal
  - Entries newest to oldest (most recent at top, after Overview)
  - Informal, daily/session notes
  - Short summaries of work done
- `docs/DEV_BLOG/README.md` - Index of available diaries and overview of diary purpose with details on structure and usage

**Only this goes here**: Diary entries and README

**Not here**: Session reports, summaries, analysis, phase progress

## Issue Tracking — GitHub is the Source of Truth

**CRITICAL POLICY**: All issues, bugs, feature requests, and enhancements MUST be tracked in **GitHub Issues** (`https://github.com/fbraz3/GeneralsX/issues/`), NOT in markdown documentation.

### Why GitHub is Source of Truth
- **Single source**: One place to track status, assign ownership, and manage priorities
- **Versioning**: GitHub automatically tracks discussion history as features evolve
- **Automation**: CI/CD, PR linking, and automation hooks depend on GitHub issues
- **Collaboration**: Easier for team members to discover, comment, and contribute
- **External visibility**: Users and contributors can search and report issues directly

### Creating New Issues

Use the `gh issue create` command to create issues:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "Brief, actionable title" \
  --body "## Context\n...\n## Goal\n...\n## Acceptance Criteria\n..." \
  --label "enhancement" \
  --label "Linux"
```

**Labels** (always apply 1-2):
- `enhancement` — New feature or improvement
- `bug` — Something isn't working
- `documentation` — Documentation improvements
- `Linux`, `macOS` — Platform-specific
- `Generals`, `Zero Hour` — Game variant
- `Blocker` — Blocks other work
- See `.github/instructions/docs.instructions.md` for complete label reference

### Markdown Documentation (Legacy)

Older `.md` files in `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES/` are **DEPRECATED**.  
- **Do NOT** create new markdown issue files
- **Remove** files that duplicate active GitHub issues
- **Archive** resolved issues in GitHub, then delete the `.md` file
- **Migrate** any investigation findings to GitHub issue comments

### Deleted/Resolved/Archived Issues

If an issue is closed/resolved in GitHub:
1. Close the issue on GitHub with appropriate resolution
2. Delete the corresponding `.md` file from `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES/`
3. Do NOT keep markdown copies of resolved issues

### Legacy `.md` Issues (Historical Reference)

If you need to reference older markdown issues for historical context:
- Keep in `docs/ETC/archive/` (not `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES/`)
- Update the path and add a note that these are archived
- Do not maintain these going forward

### `docs/BUILD/` - Platform Build Instructions
**Purpose**: Platform-specific build and environment setup guides for active platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows, etc.)
**Naming Convention**: One file per platform, all caps (e.g., `LINUX.md`, `MACOS.md`, `WINDOWS.md`)
**Content**: Step-by-step build, deploy, and troubleshooting instructions for each supported platform. These are the canonical build docs referenced by contributors and CI.

**Examples:**
- LINUX.md — Linux build instructions
- MACOS.md — macOS build instructions
- WINDOWS.md — Windows build instructions (future)

**Guidelines**:
- All new build instructions must go here (not ETC)
- Update cross-references in other docs to point to this directory
- Keep instructions up to date with build scripts and CI

**Not here**: General reference, historical analysis, or non-build docs

### `docs/ETC/` - Reference & Historical Materials
**Purpose**: Older reference materials, archived analysis, and miscellaneous documentation
- General reference materials
- Archived technical documentation
- Historical analysis documents
- Miscellaneous project materials not fitting other categories

**Guidelines**:
- New active work should NOT go here
- Use for long-term reference materials
- Archive completed analysis here if still needed for reference

**Not here**: Active phase work, current session reports, active planning, or build instructions

### `docs/HOWTO/` - User-Facing Tutorials
**Purpose**: Step-by-step guides for common tasks (configuration, troubleshooting, etc.)
**Format**: One `.md` file per tutorial, UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES naming
**Index**: `docs/HOWTO/README.md` lists all available tutorials

**Naming Convention**: `TOPIC_NAME.md` (e.g., `SAGEPATCH_CONFIGURATION.md`)

**Examples:**
- SAGEPATCH_CONFIGURATION.md — Camera, scroll, draw distance settings
- LINUX_TROUBLESHOOTING.md — Common Linux issues and fixes

**Guidelines**:
- Written for end users, not developers
- Include clear steps, examples, and troubleshooting sections
- Update `docs/HOWTO/README.md` when adding new tutorials
- Cross-link from root `README.md` if the tutorial is particularly important

**Not here**: Developer docs, build instructions, or internal work notes
