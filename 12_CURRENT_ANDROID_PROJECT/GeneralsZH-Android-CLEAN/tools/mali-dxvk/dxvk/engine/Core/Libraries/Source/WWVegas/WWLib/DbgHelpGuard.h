// This class temporarily loads and unloads dbghelp.dll from the desired location to prevent

// This helps avoid crashing on boot using recent AMD/ATI drivers, which attempt to load and use
// dbghelp.dll from the game install directory but are unable to do so without crashing because
// the dbghelp.dll that ships with the game is very old and the AMD/ATI code does not handle
// that correctly.
