# Feasibility Analysis: Porting GeneralsX/GeneralsXZH to macOS

**Date:** February 23, 2026  
**Version:** 2.0 - Updated (Linux Build Already Functional!)  
**Context:** Bender (sarcastic robot) evaluating macOS port NOW that Linux is working

"Bite my shiny metal ass!" - Bender when you told him Linux is already done

**CRITICAL UPDATE:** Linux build is **ALREADY FUNCTIONAL** with SDL3.4, DXVK, and OpenAL. This changes everything!

 ---

 ## 1. Overview

 The challenge: Compile GeneralsX/GeneralsXZH **NATIVELY** on macOS (not Wine/CrossOver/Virtualization).

**CORRECTED SITUATION:**
- Linux build is **FUNCTIONAL** (SDL3.4 ✅, DXVK ✅, OpenAL ✅ with minor bugs)
- All heavy lifting for cross-platform is DONE
- macOS now needs to **reuse** Linux infrastructure, NOT recreate it
- Only new requirement: Graphics layer for macOS (Metal or MoltenVK)

**Honest Status:** Much simpler now! You've already done 70% of the work. macOS is now a "reuse Linux + swap graphics" problem.

 ## 3. Critical Components & Viability

 ### 3.1 Graphics: DirectX 8 → ???

 #### Option A: Metal Wrapper (Recommended)
 **What it is:** A translation layer from DX8 → Metal (parallel to DXVK)

 **Complexity:** 🔴 EXTREME
 - DXVK is ~50k LOC and took years to mature
 - Metal is fundamentally different from DirectX (immediate vs deferred paradigms)
 - You would need to map:
   - D3D8 device → Metal device
   - D3D8 buffers → Metal buffers
   - D3D8 shaders (HLSL) → Metal Shading Language (MSL)
   - D3D8 states → Metal render states
 - **Estimate:** 6–12 months, 1–2 full-time developers

 **Option B: OpenGL Wrapper**
 **Complexity:** 🟡 MODERATE (OpenGL is more similar to DX8)
 - OpenGL is deprecated on macOS and not the future direction
 - **Not recommended** unless targeting legacy hardware

 **Option C: Use MoltenVK (Vulkan → Metal)**
 **Complexity:** 🟢 LOW (in theory)
 - MoltenVK translates Vulkan → Metal
 - If DXVK produces Vulkan, MoltenVK could translate Vulkan → Metal
 - **Real problem:** MoltenVK is imperfect and compatibility bugs are common
 - **Not recommended** for a production-quality port; fine for a quick prototype

 **HONEST RECOMMENDATION:** If you want proper macOS support, build a Metal wrapper. If you want a quick and dirty prototype, try MoltenVK first.

### 3.2 Audio: Miles Sound System → OpenAL

#### Current Status
- Linux: OpenAL integration is **DONE & FUNCTIONAL** ✅ (has minor bugs but working)
- macOS: CoreAudio / AudioToolbox is the standard

#### Viability: 🟢 TRIVIAL (literally just copy Linux)
- OpenAL is **cross-platform** (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Linux OpenAL code is **already battle-tested**
- Just compile same OpenAL on macOS (it "just works")
- Windows continues to use Miles (already isolated)

#### Strategy (ACTUAL):
1. Copy Linux OpenAL implementation to macOS build
2. Ensure OpenAL libs available (Homebrew or system)
3. Compile — no code changes needed (or minimal)
4. Done in ~1 week

**RECOMMENDATION:** Audio is **already solved**. Zero new engineering. Copy-paste from Linux.

### 3.3 Windowing/Input: Win32 → SDL3

#### Current Status
- Linux: SDL3.4 **FUNCTIONAL** ✅
- macOS: SDL3 supports macOS natively (Cocoa backend)

#### Viability: 🟢 **TRIVIAL** (literally drop-in)
- SDL3.4 already compiles on macOS
- On macOS: SDL3 → Cocoa backend (native)
- On Linux: SDL3 → X11/Wayland (already proven)
- **Same CMakeLists, no changes needed**

#### Implementation Example:
```cmake
if(SAGE_USE_SDL3)
    include(cmake/sdl3.cmake)  # Already works for Linux AND macOS
endif()
```

**RECOMMENDATION:** **Already solved.** SDL3 handles both platforms automatically. Just reuse.

 ---

 ### 3.4 Win32 API → POSIX/macOS

 #### Affected areas
 - File I/O (`CreateFile`, `ReadFile`, etc.)
 - Registry access (macOS: `NSUserDefaults` or plist)
 - Process management
 - Threading (`CreateThread` → pthreads)
 - Dynamic library loading (macOS: `.dylib`)
 - Window handles (Win32 `HWND` → SDL3 abstractions)

 #### Current Status
 - Linux: Win32→POSIX shims already implemented (CompatLib)
 - macOS: Can reuse ~95% of the Linux POSIX shim

 #### Complexity: 🟡 MODERATE
 - Most Win32→POSIX work is already done for Linux
 - macOS specifics:
   - Registry replacement: `NSUserDefaults` or config files
   - Application data paths: `~/Library/Application Support/`
   - `.dylib` vs `.so` nuances
   - Threading uses `pthreads` (works)

 **RECOMMENDATION:** Reuse Linux shims and adapt macOS-specific paths.

 ---

 ### 3.5 External Dependencies

 #### Current `vcpkg.json` excerpt
 ```json
 {
     "dependencies": [
         "zlib",
         "glm",
         "gli",
         { "name": "freetype", "platform": "!windows" },
         { "name": "fontconfig", "platform": "!windows" }
     ]
 }
 ```

 #### Viability: 🟢 EXCELLENT
 - `zlib`: available on macOS via Xcode CLT
 - `glm`, `gli`: header-only
 - `freetype`, `fontconfig`: available via Homebrew or MacPorts

 #### macOS-specific additions (examples):
 ```cmake
 if(APPLE)
     find_library(COREAUDIO CoreAudio)
     find_library(METAL Metal)
     find_library(COCOA Cocoa)
 endif()
 ```

 **RECOMMENDATION:** Dependencies are not a blocker on macOS.

 ## 4. Roadmap: How to Get a macOS Build

 ### Phase 0: Infrastructure (1–2 weeks)
 1. Add a CMake preset for macOS (e.g. `macos-metal-deploy`)
 2. Create a Metal graphics wrapper skeleton
 3. Add a macOS platform shim (paths, NSUserDefaults)

 ### Phase 1: Graphics Basics (3–6 months)
 1. Implement Metal device creation
 2. Implement Metal buffers
 3. Implement Metal render passes
 4. Implement shader pipeline (HLSL → MSL)
 5. Verify basic rendering (triangle, mesh, terrain)

 ### Phase 2: Audio Integration (4–8 weeks)
 1. Complete OpenAL on Linux
 2. Test OpenAL on macOS
 3. Do integration tests

 ### Phase 3: Features (2–4 weeks)
 1. Video playback (FFmpeg available)

 3. Save game location (Application Support)

 ### Phase 4: Polish & Performance (4–8 weeks)
 1. Performance profiling
 2. Apple Silicon optimization
 3. Shader tuning for Metal
 4. Multithreaded rendering

## 5. Effort Comparison (CORRECTED)

| Component | Linux (Status) | macOS (Needed) |
|---|---|---|
| Graphics | DXVK ✅ DONE | MoltenVK wrapper (~2–6 weeks, prototype) OR Metal (~6–12 months, proper) |
| Audio | OpenAL ✅ DONE | Reuse OpenAL (0 weeks, copy from Linux) |
| Windowing | SDL3.4 ✅ DONE | Reuse SDL3 (0 weeks, already supports macOS) |
| Win32→POSIX | ✅ DONE | Reuse Linux shims (~1 week, macOS paths) |
| Dependencies | ✅ DONE | Reuse vcpkg (~1 week) |
| Build System | Docker ✅ | Native CMake preset (~1 week) |
| Testing | Linux VM ✅ | macOS machine (already available) |
| **TOTAL** | **~12 months (COMPLETE)** | **~2–6 weeks (MoltenVK), or ~6–14 months (Metal)** |

## 6. Realistic Roadmaps (UPDATED - Linux is DONE)

### Scenario A: "MoltenVK (Fast Prototype)" ⭐ RECOMMENDED
1. Create macOS CMake preset (linux64-deploy → macos64-moltenvk) — **1 week**
2. Enable MoltenVK + SDL3.4 + OpenAL (copy from Linux) — **Days 1–2**
3. Compile on macOS — **Days 3–4**
4. Test menu + basic gameplay — **Days 5–7**
5. Debug compatibility issues (if any) — **Days 8–14** (unknown unknowns)

**Timeline:** ~2–3 weeks to working prototype (or sooner)

### Scenario B: "Proper Metal Wrapper" (Future)
1. Create macOS CMake preset — Week 1
2. Build Metal device wrapper skeleton — Weeks 2–4
3. Implement Metal graphics layer — Weeks 5–20 (heavy lifting)
4. Reuse Linux OpenAL/SDL3 — Weeks 21–24 (trivial)
5. Polish & performance — Weeks 25–30

**Timeline:** ~6–8 months full-time for quality Metal port

### Scenario C: "macOS via Wine/Virtualization"
1. Already works today (use existing binary) — Immediate
2. Run under Wine Crossover — Now


 **Timeline:** Today, but not native.

 ## 7. Key Files to Modify (if choosing Metal)

 ```
 CMakePresets.json
 cmake/metal.cmake (new, parallel to dx8.cmake)
 cmake/config-build.cmake (add SAGE_USE_METAL flag)
 Core/GameEngineDevice/Include/MetalDevice/ (new)
 Core/GameEngineDevice/Source/MetalDevice/ (new)
 Core/Libraries/Source/Platform/macOS/ (new)
 scripts/macos-setup-metal.sh (new)
 ```

 ## 8. Risks & Unknowns

 ### 🟢 Low Risk
 - OpenAL integration
 - SDL3 windowing
 - Dependency management

 ### 🟡 Medium Risk
 - Shader compilation (HLSL → MSL)
 - Apple Silicon (ARM64) testing
 - Application data paths

 ### 🔴 High Risk
 - API surface mismatch (DirectX vs Metal)
 - Determinism (game replay compatibility)
 - Performance tuning and shader bugs
 - Bink video codec licensing/porting

 ### 🟣 Unknown Unknowns
 - Assumptions about `HWND` usage in game logic
 - Miles→OpenAL subtleties on macOS

 xcode-select --install
 brew install cmake ninja git
 brew install freetype
 brew install llvm@21  # optional for clang-tidy
 ```

 ### Libraries (vcpkg or Homebrew)
 ```bash
 zlib, glm, gli, freetype, fontconfig
 SDL3 (via FetchContent or Homebrew)
 OpenAL (if system not sufficient)
 ```

 ### Xcode
 - Metal framework and MSL compiler
 - Xcode Command Line Tools

 ---

 ## 10. Final Recommendation (Bender's Honest Opinion)

 **Q: Should you do a macOS port?**

 **A:** It depends.

 ### ✅ Do it if:
 - You have 5–10 months full-time (or 10–20 months part-time)
 - You want a proper native Metal port
 - You have a macOS machine for testing
 - You can debug Metal issues

 ### ⚠️ Don't do it now if:
 - Linux Phase 1+2 are not finished
 - You want a quick hack (use Wine/Virtualization)
 - Your team is small (Graphics wrapper is a large project)

 ### Recommended Strategy
 1. Finish Linux Phase 1 (DXVK) and Phase 2 (OpenAL)
 2. Revisit a macOS port once Linux is stable and audio is done

 ### Quick Shortcut (if you need something now)
 - Prototype with **MoltenVK**: compile DXVK and try Vulkan→Metal translation
 - If MoltenVK works well, you have a quick path; if not, you know the effort required for Metal

## 11. Conclusion (CORRECTED - Linux is FUNCTIONAL)

WOW. You already have a **working Linux build**. That changes *everything*.

**Good news (actually GREAT news):**
- ✅ Audio (OpenAL) is **DONE** on Linux — copy to macOS
- ✅ Windowing (SDL3.4) is **DONE** on Linux — works native on macOS
- ✅ Platform shims (Win32→POSIX) are **DONE** — reuse 95% for macOS
- ✅ All dependencies are **AVAILABLE** on macOS
- 🎉 **70% of work is already finished**

**The ONLY new requirement:**
- Graphics layer for macOS: Use **MoltenVK** (quick) or build **Metal** wrapper (long-term)

**Path Forward:**

1. **IMMEDIATE (2–3 weeks):** Build MoltenVK prototype
   - Create `macos64-moltenvk` CMake preset
   - Reuse Linux's SDL3.4, OpenAL, CompatLib
   - Compile on macOS, test if MoltenVK→Metal translation works
   - If works: you have a playable macOS build RIGHT NOW
   - If broken: you understand the effort for proper Metal

2. **LATER (6–8 months, if MoltenVK doesn't cut it):** Build proper Metal wrapper
   - Real Metal device implementation
   - HLSL→MSL shader compilation
   - Performance tuning for Apple Silicon

**My Recommendation:** Start MoltenVK THIS WEEK. You could have a playable macOS build by early March. 😎
