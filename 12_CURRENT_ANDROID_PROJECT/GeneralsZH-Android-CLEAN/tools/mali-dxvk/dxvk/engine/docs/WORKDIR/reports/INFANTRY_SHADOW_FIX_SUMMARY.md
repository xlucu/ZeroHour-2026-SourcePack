# Summary: Infantry Shadow & Texture Rendering Fixes (Generals Base Game)

This report summarizes the visual bugs affecting infantry rendering (black silhouettes and pitch-black torso textures) in C&C Generals base game, the solutions implemented, and recommendations for validation and next steps.

---

## 1. Fog of War (FOW) & Shroud Fix
*   **Problem**: Terrain under the Fog of War rendered as a solid black block under Vulkan/DXVK, while objects on top of it rendered normally.
*   **Root Cause**: Generals base game used a legacy scrolling shroud texture window. The dynamic offset coordinate mapping wrapped incorrectly or went out of bounds under Vulkan/DXVK texture sampling conventions.
*   **Solution**: Backported Zero Hour's static map-wide shroud texture behavior.
    *   **File Modified**: [W3DShroud.cpp](file:///Users/felipebraz/PhpstormProjects/pessoal/GeneralsX/Generals/Code/GameEngineDevice/Source/W3DDevice/GameClient/W3DShroud.cpp)
    *   **Changes**: Updated dimension allocations to match full map cell coordinates (`dstTextureWidth = m_numCellsX; dstTextureHeight = m_numCellsY;`) and locked rendering bounds to the entire map size inside `render()`.

---

## 2. Volumetric Shadow Skip for Skinned/Character Hierarchies
*   **Problem**: Infantry models initially drew as completely black silhouettes.
*   **Root Cause**: Skinned meshes (skeletal animations) cannot have CPU stencil shadow volumes projected accurately in real time. Running the CPU volumetric shadow generation code on animated meshes left the Vulkan/DXVK stencil pipeline in an invalid state, rendering the caster pitch black.
*   **Solution**: Skip shadow volume generation for any mesh or hierarchy with skinned vertices.
    *   **File Modified**: [W3DVolumetricShadow.cpp](file:///Users/felipebraz/PhpstormProjects/pessoal/GeneralsX/Generals/Code/GameEngineDevice/Source/W3DDevice/GameClient/Shadow/W3DVolumetricShadow.cpp)
    *   **Changes**:
        1.  In `W3DShadowGeometry::initFromMesh`, returned `FALSE` if the mesh is flagged as `MeshGeometryClass::SKIN`.
        2.  In `W3DShadowGeometry::initFromHLOD`, added a recursive check over all LOD levels. If *any* sub-mesh in the hierarchy contains the `MeshGeometryClass::SKIN` flag, the entire HLOD is skipped from casting volumetric shadows. This properly handles characters who have rigid attachments (like the GLA Worker's vest/torso and shovel/hammer).

## 3. Skinned Mesh Vertex Diffuse Color (Black Torso Fix)
*   **Problem**: After skipping shadow volumes, the limbs and tools of the GLA Worker rendered normally, but his torso/vest remained pitch black.
*   **Root Cause**:
    *   The torso/vest sub-mesh is a skinned mesh but does not define an explicit vertex color/pre-lighting array (`diffuse == nullptr`).
    *   In the skin rendering pipeline (`DX8SkinFVFCategoryContainer::Render` and `compose_deformed_vertex_buffer`), when `diffuse` is null, the code set the vertex diffuse field to `0` (opaque black). Under Vulkan/DXVK, this multiplied the texture color by zero, resulting in a solid black rendering.
    *   For comparison, the rigid rendering path correctly defaults to `0xFFFFFFFF` (opaque white) when no vertex colors are provided.
*   **Solution**: Set the default vertex diffuse color to `0xFFFFFFFF` when the model's diffuse color array is null.
    *   **Files Modified**:
        1.  [dx8renderer.cpp](file:///Users/felipebraz/PhpstormProjects/pessoal/GeneralsX/Core/Libraries/Source/WWVegas/WW3D2/dx8renderer.cpp#L1368) — Updated `DX8SkinFVFCategoryContainer::Render` fallback.
        2.  [meshmdl.cpp](file:///Users/felipebraz/PhpstormProjects/pessoal/GeneralsX/Generals/Code/Libraries/Source/WWVegas/WW3D2/meshmdl.cpp#L364) — Updated `MeshModelClass::compose_deformed_vertex_buffer` fallback.

## 4. Black Square Shadows ("Mancha Preta") Fix
*   **Problem**: In the base game, the shadows of buildings rendered as solid black squares (mancha preta). Additionally, infantry standing in these regions or casting their own decal shadows appeared completely black, stripped of dynamic lighting.
*   **Root Cause**: 
    *   The base game's `W3DProjectedShadow.cpp` contained a bug where shadow flags were destructively overwritten instead of bitwise-combined.
    *   Specifically, `shadowType = SHADOW_DECAL;` destroyed the `SHADOW_ALPHA_DECAL` flag that was passed from the building's shadow descriptor.
    *   This caused the alpha decal shadows to fall back to `_PresetMultiplicativeShader` (which multiplies the ground by the black RGB channels of the mask) instead of using `_PresetAlphaShader`.
*   **Solution**: Backported the Zero Hour bitmask handling logic.
    *   **File Modified**: `Generals/Code/GameEngineDevice/Source/W3DDevice/GameClient/Shadow/W3DProjectedShadow.cpp`
    *   **Changes**: Replaced assignment operators (`=`, `==`) with bitwise OR (`|`) and bitwise AND (`&`) when computing `shadowType` and verifying capabilities (e.g. `m_type & SHADOW_DECAL`).

## 5. Current State & Recent Fixes
*   **Branch**: `issue-88-fog-of-war-terrain`
*   **Recent Fixes Implemented**:
    1.  **Infantry Light Clamping**: Clamped infantry ambient and diffuse lighting scales to `(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f)` using `Vector3::Cap_Absolute_To` in [W3DScene.cpp](file:///Users/felipebraz/PhpstormProjects/pessoal/GeneralsX/Generals/Code/GameEngineDevice/Source/W3DDevice/GameClient/W3DScene.cpp). This prevents Vulkan/DXVK shader overflows that rendered infantry pitch black.
    2.  **Decal Batch Initialization Fix**: Corrected initialization of `lastShadowDecalTexture` and `lastShadowType` in [W3DProjectedShadow.cpp](file:///Users/felipebraz/PhpstormProjects/pessoal/GeneralsX/Generals/Code/GameEngineDevice/Source/W3DDevice/GameClient/Shadow/W3DProjectedShadow.cpp) loops from `m_shadowList`/`m_decalList` to the current `shadow`'s texture and type. This prevents decal batches from flushing with invalid states when disabled or non-decal shadows are at the head of the list.
    3.  **Dynamic Projected Shadows**: Integrated `SHADOW_DYNAMIC_PROJECTION` flags in `addShadow` to ensure animated caster shadow textures are correctly refreshed per frame.
    4.  **Decal Mask in Shadow Caster**: Updated the shadow type check in `addShadow` to accept `SHADOW_ALPHA_DECAL` and `SHADOW_ADDITIVE_DECAL` as valid decal shadows (via mask check `SHADOW_DECAL | SHADOW_ALPHA_DECAL | SHADOW_ADDITIVE_DECAL`), ensuring building alpha decal shadows are properly created.
*   **Build & Deploy**: The `GeneralsX` base game was successfully rebuilt and deployed to the `GeneralsX/Generals` folder.
*   **Follow-Up Verification**:
    *   **@felipebraz**: Please launch the base game and verify if building shadows are rendering with proper alpha transparency (not black squares) and if infantry units render normally with correct lighting and textures. 
    *   You can launch it by running `cd ~/GeneralsX/Generals && ./run.sh -win`.

## 6. Smoke Test Checklist
When starting a new session with an empty context, perform the following validation:

1.  **Smoke Test Infantry**:
    *   Launch Generals base game on macOS:
        ```bash
        cd ~/GeneralsX/Generals && ./run.sh -win
        ```
    *   Spawn various GLA, USA, and China infantry units (Workers, Rebels, Rangers, Red Guards).
    *   Verify that they render with correct lighting, textures, and default team color overlays on all sub-meshes (torso, limbs, weapons) without any black segments.
2.  **Smoke Test ZH Infantry** (same units in GeneralsMD):
    *   Launch Zero Hour on macOS.
    *   Verify infantry renders correctly — shadow volumes should not corrupt stencil state for any skinned mesh.
