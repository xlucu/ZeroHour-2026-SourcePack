# True fullscreen at native resolution

## Symptom

The game rendered into a 4:3 pillar‑boxed area in the middle of the screen instead of filling
the phone's 1640×720 display, and the Options → Resolution list could crash.

## Root cause

The engine's resolution handling was written for a Win32 render device that enumerates a table
of display modes. On Android/DXVK there is no such table:

1. `buildFilteredResolutions()` called `WW3D::Get_Render_Device_Desc(0).Enumerate_Resolutions()`
   which dereferenced an empty table and **SIGSEGV'd** the moment the Options menu built its
   resolution list.
2. Nothing told the 3D backbuffer, the 2D UI and the mouse to use the real device size, so they
   defaulted to a 4:3 mode and got letter/pillar‑boxed.

## Fix (`W3DDisplay.cpp`)

- On Android, `buildFilteredResolutions()` returns just the **single native display resolution**
  (published by `SDL3Main.cpp`) instead of enumerating an empty Win32 table — no crash, and the
  Options list shows the correct mode.
- `W3DDisplay::init()` sets `m_xResolution`/`m_yResolution` to the real device size so the 3D
  backbuffer, the 2D UI and the mouse are all in agreement — the game fills the screen edge to
  edge at 1640×720.

Result: native‑resolution fullscreen, correct terrain/water/textures, and an Options menu that
doesn't crash.

## Follow‑up: side black bars from the display cutout (`styles.xml`)

Even after the engine renders at the native resolution, a phone with a **display cutout**
(punch‑hole / notch camera) can still show a **black bar on one side** in landscape. That bar is
not the engine's doing — it's Android reserving the cutout region because the app never opted into
drawing there. With `targetSdkVersion 35` (edge‑to‑edge enforced) this is especially visible.

Fix in the app theme:

```xml
<style name="AppTheme" parent="android:Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen">
    <item name="android:windowLayoutInDisplayCutoutMode">shortEdges</item>
</style>
```

`shortEdges` lets the game extend into the cutout on the short edges (left/right in landscape),
which removes the side bar. It needs API 28+ (the app's `minSdk` is 28). This is pure app
configuration — no engine or SDL code is touched.
